# M4R: Classification and evolution of interdisciplinary science

**Section:** Applied

**Supervisor:** Dr. Prasun Ray

**Author:** Yiting Mao, Mathematics Department, Imperial College London

**Key words:** Classification, interdisciplinary science, LDA, LSTM, BERT, binary classification, multi-class classification.

**Description:**

Often, scientific works are classified by their subject-area, e.g. “astrophysics”. However, as science evolves, the boundaries between subject areas are also expected to evolve, and the aim of this project is to investigate the aptness of standard subject boundaries by developing and applying the capacity to identify scientific papers which are inherently interdisciplinary. The initial goals of this project will be to train classifiers like LSTM neural networks to identify the subject area of a scientific paper based on its abstract and then to use these classifiers to identify papers which do not readily “fit” into a single category. Results obtained from these computations will then be used to determine which areas in the sciences have a tendency to cross traditional subject boundaries and how these tendencies have evolved over time. The final task will be to analyze connections between these tendencies and the structure of scientific collaboration networks.

**Research Progress:**
1. Build familiarity with methods for generating vector representations of text.
2. Build familiarity with LDA model and get prediction results for binary classification.
3. Build familiarity with LSTM neural networks and get prediction results for binary classification.
4. Build familiarity with BERT model and get prediction results for multi-class classification in progress.
5. Consider a larger number of subject areas followed by an investigation of
  - Which subject areas (or combinations of subject areas) tend to produce multidisciplinary work
  - The evolution of these trends over time.
6. A collaboration network for paper authors will be constructed and the role of multidisciplinary researchers in this network will be investigated
